Groovy, Grails, Google, and Gangs

This is a web application I wrote in 2007 for a demo.  It is an example of the rapid prototyping made possible by Groovy and Grails.  This application is used to catalog and track gang activity using Google Maps and the Google Charts API.

To run this application on your own machine:
1.  Download/Checkout the code from this repository.
2.  Run "grails run-app" in the root directory of this project on your machine.

This application assumes that Java, Groovy, and Grails are installed on your machine.

I've tested this application with:
- Java 1.6
- Groovy 1.5 and 1.7
- Grails 1.2.2
- Windows and Ubuntu Linux

Since it was just a quick demo app it lacks proper unit tests (shame on me).
